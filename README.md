# Random Password Generator

This project is an implementation in C of a primitive generator of pseudorandom strings, which can serve as a password generator (at your own risk).

## How to use

The program receives two arguments: the first is the string size, and the latter refers to the number of strings the program will generate.

## Compiling

I used GCC for compiling, but Clang's syntax is similar. Run the command below inside the project directory.
```
gcc *.c -o main
```
