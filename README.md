# Random Password Generator

This project is an implementation in C of a primitive generator of pseudorandom strings, which can serve as a password generator (at your own risk).

## How to used

The program receives two arguments: the first is the string size, and the latter refers to the number of strings the program will generate.

## Compiling

I used GCC for compiling, but Clang's syntax is the same. Run the command below inside the project directory.
'''
gcc *.c -o main
'''
